          Hello! My name is Samuel. I'm a passionate technophile who loves
          building stuff with code and seeing them come alive as living products
          on the web.

          I've had an interest in computers for as long as I can remember, but
          first experience with programming was when in 2014 when I came across
          a Java textbook at a friend's place. It caught my interest and I was
          able to understand a bit of what was being explained but the rest
          remained inscrutable to me. I had other stuff going on at the time,
          especially my music, which made me put off learning it. (Also, the
          syntax was quite annoying ðŸ¤­)
