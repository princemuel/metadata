            Hi there! Thanks for sticking with me till this point. If you're looking for a fast,
            performant, user-friendly, SEO and accessibility compliant website to represent your
            product or business, want a consultation or you'd just like to say hi (wave emoji),
            please feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear about what you're working on and how I
            could help.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm also currently looking for a new role as a Frontend Engineer and open to a wide
            range of opportunities. My preference would be to work remotely... But I'd also be happy
            to hear about opportunites that don't fit that description. I'm a hard-working and
            positive person who will always approach each task with a sense of purpose and attention
            to detail. Please, do feel free to check out my online profiles below and/or send me a
            message using the form below. I will do my best to respond in a timely manner. (smile
            emoji)
