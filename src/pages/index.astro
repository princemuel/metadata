              fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. What

                  Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Mother,
                  with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after
                  all, Dad almost killed him with the car. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing
                  boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a
                  parked car with a boy. Thanks a lot, kid. Mom, is that you?
